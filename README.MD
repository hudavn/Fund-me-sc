# Smart Contract - Fund me 
This is smart contract that fund and withdraw Ethereum from users with some restrictions:
- Minimum fund/deposit is 50 USD.
- Only be withdrawn by owner.


Something I have achieved after finishing this:
- Working with dependencies, mock other contract (Chainlink) for importing some functions to my own contract.
- Practicing more with smart contract (access assets).
- More understanding about how to deploy and test on various net.
- Fork any blockchains to local for personal purposes.
- More interacting with brownie-config.yaml about environments.
- Figure out some issues about gas price when deploying (there is a litte bias in calculation and conversion).
